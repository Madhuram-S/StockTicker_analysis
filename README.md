# Unit 2 | Assignment - The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

In this assignment you will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

### Files

* [Test Data](Instructions/Resources/alphabtical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

* [Stock Data](Instructions/Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.

### Step 1

* Create a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.

* display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume.

* The result should look as follows (note: all solution images are for 2015 data).

### Step 2

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks and take the following info.

  * Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.

  * The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.

  * The total Volume of the stock

  * Ticker symbol

* Add a conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

* The result should look as follows.

### Step 3

* locate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

* Solution will look as follows.

### Replicate

* Make the appropriate adjustments to the script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.

### Other Considerations

* The sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing the code. This dataset is smaller and aids in testing faster.
